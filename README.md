# acpilight: a backward-compatibile xbacklight replacement

---

"acpilight" is a backward-compatibile replacement for xbacklight_ that uses the
ACPI interface to set the display brightness. On modern laptops "acpilight" can
control both display and keyboard backlight uniformly on either X11, the
console or Wayland.


## Motivation

On some modern laptops "XRandR" might lack the ability to set the display
brightness. This capability was moved/unified to the kernel's ACPI interface,
via ``/sys/class/backlight/``.

"acpilight" provides a drop-in replacement for the ``xbacklight`` command that
uses the ACPI interface instead of "XRandR", allowing old scripts to run. As a
result, ``xbacklight`` can subsequently be used also from the console and
Wayland (X11 is not used at all).

When paired with the ddcci-backlight_ kernel module, the backlight of most
professional external monitors can be controlled as well.


## Installation

If you have ``make`` available, to install the executable, man page, and udev
rules; run::

```
sudo make install
```

## Setup

Normally, users are prohibited to alter files in the ``sys`` filesystem. It's
advisable (and *recommended*) to setup an "udev" rule to allow users in the
"video" group to set the display brightness.

To do so, place a file in ``/etc/udev/rules.d/90-backlight.rules``

Keyboard backlight control is also available on certain laptop models via the
"leds" subsystem. The following laptop models are known to have a controllable
keyboard backlight:

- Lenovo ThinkPad: ``-ctrl tpacpi::kbd_backlight``
- Apple MacBook Pro: ``-ctrl smc::kbd_backlight``
- Dell Latitude/XPS: ``-ctrl dell::kbd_backlight``
- Asus N-Series Notebooks: ``-ctrl asus::kbd_backlight``

Please report if other laptops have working interfaces to control the keyboard
backlight.

If you have an external monitor with which supports the DDC/CI protocol,
backlight control can be enabled by installing the `appropriate drivers
<ddcci-backlight_>`_ and loading the ``ddcci-backlight`` module at boot
time. On Debian, this is done by installing the ``ddcci-dkms`` package
and then appending ``ddcci-backlight`` to ``/etc/modules``.


## Differences from xbacklight

The original "xbacklight" sets the display brightness of the current
``$DISPLAY``, whereas "acpilight" ignores ``$DISPLAY`` completely and sets the
brightness of the first device found in ``/sys/class/backlight`` by default. On
systems with multiple panels, they might differ.

Use ``xbacklight -list`` to see the full list of available devices that can be
controlled; then use the ``-ctrl`` flag to control them individually.

"acpilight" can always *query*, but might not necessarily be allowed to *set*
the brightness of all listed devices depending on the current user and
permissions. See the setup section above to set the permissions correctly.

"acpilight" doesn't fade: the requested brightness is set immediately by
default. For smooth transitions, specify the number of fading steps (using
``-steps``) or, more conveniently, the fading frame rate (``-fps``).
